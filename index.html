        <p>The about page contains most of the information on this website. I was going to include a picture of the KSU campus that I took, but I couldn't find one on my phone.</p>
        <p> So instead here is a photo of the Ketchikan sign I took on my honeymoon cruise to Alaska.</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img id="about-img" src="11875.jpeg" alt="Your Photo">
        <p>I am Garrett Davis, a passionate college student/process engineer with three and a half years of experience in engineering. Throughout my career, I have worked for one main company, Unique Fabricating. That was until last November when they filed for bankruptcy and everyone who worked there lost their jobs. I worked an hourly job for around a month and then the company that purchased the Unique assets brought me back in to help launch and start the location again.</p>
        <p>In addition to my professional endeavors, I also enjoy spending time with my wife, reading, watching movies, and playing video games. We also have started enjoying going to top golf and trivia nights with friends. I have mainly been reading fantasy books for most of my life and the main games I play are League of Legends, Rocket League and some other random games with friends. I would say my favorite game series of all time is the Dark Souls series though.</p>
        <p>My journey through KSU has been any interesting one. I started majoring in computer engineering, and did that until I started an internship. After around a year of being in the internship, the person I was interning under got a promotion and they offered me his position. I took the job and took a year off from KSU to focus fully on my job, but when I started trying to attend again I realized that the computer engineering major couldn't be completed fully online. So, I changed to computer science as I still wanted to get a degree and the concentration in data analysis will still be useful for my job.</p>
